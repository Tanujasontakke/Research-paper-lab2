        Addendum
        <p>Tic-Tac-Toe game is developed with JavaScript code. The primary problem addressed is the creation of a dynamic and responsive game board, allowing players to take turns and determining the winner based on common Tic Tac Toe rules.
          I have used event listeners to detect user clicks on individual cells within the game grid. 
          Upon each click, the JavaScript code responds by updating the game state and then checking for a winner or a draw, and dynamically switching between "X" and "O" players. 
          The game status is displayed, indicating the current player or announcing the winner.
          <br>
          Challenges I faced:
            Game Board Initialization: One challenge was initializing the game board dynamically, for which I created the grid using loop and assigning appropriate event listeners to each cell.
            Winner Determination: For selecting the appropriate winner I tried iterating through predefined win patterns and comparing the values in the corresponding cells.
            Resetting the Game: this was challenging due to the need to reassign event listeners. So I separated the game initialization logic into a dedicated function and called it when needed.
            Displaying Winner: Initially, the winner was not displayed correctly after a win. I resolved this updating the status display with the winning player's information.</p>
