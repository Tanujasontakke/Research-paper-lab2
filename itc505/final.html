        Addendum:<br>
The dynamic creation of the reset button in JavaScript helped with easy manipulation and avoids cluttering the HTML file with unnecessary elements.
The use of the "is-off" class to toggle the appearance of black squares and white squares helped simplify the styling and made the code more readable.
The grid layout in CSS provided neat and organized structure for the game board, enhancing the visual appeal.
I faced Challenges for debugging the game logic and ensuring that the randomization of the initial board state works as expected. Consistent testing and debugging helped overcome these challenges.
Code is structured in modularised way separating html css and javascript part.
