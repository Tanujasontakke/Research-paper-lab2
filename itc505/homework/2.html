  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
     In Fall 2019, select faculty from three different colleges at “the University” gathered to design a new, fully online Masters in Cybersecurity degree program. These faculty 
     represented the Colleges of Humanities (Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice), Business (Department of Information Systems), and Computing (Departments of 
     Computer Science, Software Engineering and Game Design, and Information Technology). The team quickly developed the program goals, curriculum, and program resource needs. 
     The program was approved in February 2020, with a start date of Fall 2020. The proposal included an expectation of hiring 14 additional faculty members over four years to 
     accommodate projected growth, with the goal of 200 majors by Fall 2024. The program had an ambitious goal to support students seeking to advance current careers and to enable the 
     career transition of those entering the cybersecurity field.<br><br> 
     The initial admission criteria required students to have a computing foundation consisting of object-oriented programming, computing infrastructure (computer 
     organization & architecture and operating systems, data communications and networking), and principles of cybersecurity. Students lacking this knowledge were 
     required to take up to three 5000-level foundation courses.  
     <br>
     <h4>The program of study was proposed as:</h4>
	Required Courses (30 Credit Hours) {staffing department}:<br>
    <ul>
	<li>Cyber Law, Policy, and Enforcement {SCJ}</li>
	<li>Cybercrime Detection, Analysis, and Forensics {SCJ}</li>
	<li>Secure Application Development {SWEGD}</li>
	<li>Securing Enterprise Infrastructure {IT}</li>
	<li>Management of Cybersecurity {IS}</li>
	<li>Mobile and Cloud Security {IT}</li>
	<li>Contingency Planning and Response {IS}</li>
	<li>Cyber Analytics and Intelligence {IT}</li>
	<li>Introduction to Cryptography and Its Application {CS}</li>
	<li>Capstone in Cybersecurity Practicum {IT} or Capstone in Cybersecurity Management {IS}</li>
    </ul> 
      The Institute for Cybersecurity was established in 2016 
      as the home for an online, multidisciplinary BS Cybersecurity program. This program was also created as a collaboration between the same three colleges. The Institute’s Executive Director reports to the three Deans and oversees all Cybersecurity degree programs. A Director of Research and Graduate Education and a Director of Undergraduate Education and Outreach, report to the Executive Director. The University has been designated/redesignated as an NSA National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education (or equivalent) multiple times since 2004, including redesignation in 2022.

  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  <p>
      And then COVID hit. Even though the program was already scheduled to be fully online, the pandemic created issues. In addition to requiring all programs to transition to online instruction, the State Board of Governors suspended 
      all hiring in anticipation of budget shortfalls resulting from a projected decrease in state revenue. The University’s leadership mandated that the program move forward but 
      required the exploration of alternative solutions. Applications to the program quickly exceeded expectations with over 130 applying for Fall 2020, and an additional 142 for Spring 2021. Within the first group, 33.3% 
      identified themselves as Female, 64% as Male, and 3% did not answer. The pool was also ethnically diverse with 40.9% identifying themselves as Black, 38.3% as White, 5.2% as 
      Asian, 4.3% as Hispanic/Latino, 1.7% as American Indian or Alaskan Native, with 9.6% not answering. A majority (58.1%) of applicants were “career changers” with noncomputing undergraduate degrees. An additional 28.2% had 
      computing undergraduate degrees, but only 13.7% had security-related coursework. The number of applicants and restrictions on hiring required the program’s leadership to quickly identify 
      solutions to course instructional staffing. There is a national shortage of cybersecurity faculty [1]; however, the national need for cybersecurity professionals [1, 2, et al.] and 
      corresponding interest in cybersecurity careers mandated that the program move forward.
	  
    The constraints on potential solutions to the staffing challenge were as follows:
   <ul>
	<li>Does not involve the hiring of permanent, full-time, faculty.</li>
	<li>Allows unrestricted growth of the degree program.</li>
	<li>Supports regional accreditation guidelines for general and graduate-level instruction.</li>
	<li>Supports the delivery of a fully online curriculum.</li>
   </ul>
