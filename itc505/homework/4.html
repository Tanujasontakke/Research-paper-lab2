  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
     In Fall 2019, select faculty from three different colleges at “the University” gathered to design a new, fully online Masters in Cybersecurity degree program. These faculty 
     represented the Colleges of Humanities (Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice), Business (Department of Information Systems), and Computing (Departments of 
     Computer Science, Software Engineering and Game Design, and Information Technology). The team quickly developed the program goals, curriculum, and program resource needs. 
     The program was approved in February 2020, with a start date of Fall 2020. The proposal included an expectation of hiring 14 additional faculty members over four years to 
     accommodate projected growth, with the goal of 200 majors by Fall 2024. The program had an ambitious goal to support students seeking to advance current careers and to enable the 
     career transition of those entering the cybersecurity field.<br><br> 
     The initial admission criteria required students to have a computing foundation consisting of object-oriented programming, computing infrastructure (computer 
     organization & architecture and operating systems, data communications and networking), and principles of cybersecurity. Students lacking this knowledge were 
     required to take up to three 5000-level foundation courses.  
     <br>
     <h4>The program of study was proposed as:</h4>
	Required Courses (30 Credit Hours) {staffing department}:<br>
    <ul>
	<li>Cyber Law, Policy, and Enforcement {SCJ}</li>
	<li>Cybercrime Detection, Analysis, and Forensics {SCJ}</li>
	<li>Secure Application Development {SWEGD}</li>
	<li>Securing Enterprise Infrastructure {IT}</li>
	<li>Management of Cybersecurity {IS}</li>
	<li>Mobile and Cloud Security {IT}</li>
	<li>Contingency Planning and Response {IS}</li>
	<li>Cyber Analytics and Intelligence {IT}</li>
	<li>Introduction to Cryptography and Its Application {CS}</li>
	<li>Capstone in Cybersecurity Practicum {IT} or Capstone in Cybersecurity Management {IS}</li>
    </ul> 
      The Institute for Cybersecurity was established in 2016 
      as the home for an online, multidisciplinary BS Cybersecurity program. This program was also created as a collaboration between the same three colleges. The Institute’s Executive Director reports to the three Deans and oversees all Cybersecurity degree programs. A Director of Research and Graduate Education and a Director of Undergraduate Education and Outreach, report to the Executive Director. The University has been designated/redesignated as an NSA National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education (or equivalent) multiple times since 2004, including redesignation in 2022.

  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  <p>
      And then COVID hit. Even though the program was already scheduled to be fully online, the pandemic created issues. In addition to requiring all programs to transition to online instruction, the State Board of Governors suspended 
      all hiring in anticipation of budget shortfalls resulting from a projected decrease in state revenue. The University’s leadership mandated that the program move forward but 
      required the exploration of alternative solutions. Applications to the program quickly exceeded expectations with over 130 applying for Fall 2020, and an additional 142 for Spring 2021. Within the first group, 33.3% 
      identified themselves as Female, 64% as Male, and 3% did not answer. The pool was also ethnically diverse with 40.9% identifying themselves as Black, 38.3% as White, 5.2% as 
      Asian, 4.3% as Hispanic/Latino, 1.7% as American Indian or Alaskan Native, with 9.6% not answering. A majority (58.1%) of applicants were “career changers” with noncomputing undergraduate degrees. An additional 28.2% had 
      computing undergraduate degrees, but only 13.7% had security-related coursework. The number of applicants and restrictions on hiring required the program’s leadership to quickly identify 
      solutions to course instructional staffing. There is a national shortage of cybersecurity faculty [1]; however, the national need for cybersecurity professionals [1, 2, et al.] and 
      corresponding interest in cybersecurity careers mandated that the program move forward.
	  
    The constraints on potential solutions to the staffing challenge were as follows:
   <ul>
	<li>Does not involve the hiring of permanent, full-time, faculty.</li>
	<li>Allows unrestricted growth of the degree program.</li>
	<li>Supports regional accreditation guidelines for general and graduate-level instruction.</li>
	<li>Supports the delivery of a fully online curriculum.</li>
   </ul>
   </p>
  <hr>
 <h2>Praposed Solution</h2>
	<p>
	To address these challenges, the program’s leadership identified several initiatives to be evaluated and 
implemented, if feasible. Some of these stemmed from faculty experiences teaching massive open online courses 
(MOOCs) [e.g., 3, 4], while others were obtained from experiences with large, physical classes. These included:
• The migration of the program’s 5000-level remediation courses to self-paced, continuing & 
professional education (CPE) courses, • As traditional Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) 
were not available, the use of part-time faculty serving as “Assistant Instructors” to support large 
class sizes, • The identification and dissemination of best practices for large online classes and online labs 
providing experiential learning. <br><br>
		<i>A. Moving Prerequisites to CPE Modules</i><br> <br>
		When the MS-Cybersecurity was implemented, it 
included 5000-level prerequisite courses to remediate any shortfalls in foundational knowledge. 
		These included:
		<ul> 
	<li>Programming Principles - foundational program constructs, and software design & development, 
object-oriented program constructs, software engineering concepts, and organization </li>
requirements. <li> Computing Infrastructure - computer networks and system administration, network protocols, traffic 
analysis, OS fundamentals, and systems management.</li> <li> Foundations of Cybersecurity - the roles and 
composition of the cybersecurity function in the organization, components of the cybersecurity 
program including administrative and technical 
roles, responsibilities, and controls.</li>
		</ul>
These foundation courses alone would require up to nine 
instructors as approximately 75% of accepted students had 
non-computing undergraduate degrees.
The 5000-level prerequisites were migrated to 
instructional modules offered through the University’s 
College of Professional Education. These courses were 
redesigned as self-paced, gated courses with faculty 
supervision. Students were able to complete modules before 
the start of the term, removing prerequisites for major 
coursework. The gates implemented were end-of-module 
quizzes, requiring students to score at least 70% (multiple 
attempts possible) before the following topic is available. 
Each module concluded with a comprehensive exam, 
requiring students to score at least 70% to receive credit for 
the module, with only three attempts permitted before 
requiring the student to retake the course.
During the migration process, the leadership team 
recommended splitting the infrastructure class into a data 
communications & networking class and a computer 
organization, architecture, and operating systems class. This 
resulted in up to four CPE courses for some students.
In the first term, 26% of accepted students did not need 
any prerequisites, 15.6% needed one, 19.8% needed two, and 
38.5% needed all three. In the second semester, using the 
CPE-based prerequisites, 18.3% did not require any CPE 
prerequisite courses, 23.3% required one CPE course, 14.1% 
required two CPE courses, 9.8% required three, and 23.9% 
required all four.<br><br>
<i>B. Assistant Instructors and Very Large Class Sizes</i><br><br>
Most instructional faculty are familiar with Graduate 
Teaching Assistants, typically doctoral students who have 
been assigned to assist a course instructor in conducting a 
course and managing its students, with some GTAs serving 
as teaching faculty themselves. Unfortunately, the University 
does not have sufficient doctoral students qualified to serve 
in this capacity. GTAs are commonly used at the 
undergraduate level; however, the need of the MS-CYBR 
degree program required assistance at the graduate level, a 
challenge due to the special qualifications required for 
teaching in the Graduate College, namely an established 
record of quality research and teaching.
