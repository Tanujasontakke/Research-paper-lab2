  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  The overriding message from the literature on large 
online classes is that instructors must acknowledge their 
limitations. Realizing the difficulty of managing large online 
classes using the same approach as smaller, face-to-face 
classes, the instructor can still delivery high-quality, effective 
instruction through effective planning, maximizing the use of 
support personnel (i.e. GTAs, AIs), and incorporating many 
of the best practices presented here. Faculty can maximize 
student learning and minimize concerns in large online 
courses by communicating effectively ensuring all 
constituents engage in an informed and deliberate manner. 
One of the innovations discovered in this process was the 
ability to include industry expertise from practicing 
Cybersecurity professionals serving as AIs. The stringent 
requirements for graduate faculty typically exclude such 
expertise.<br><br>
The degree program used as the foundation of this study 
continues to grow, with almost 200 Fall 2022 applicants. The 
program still only offers 11 sections at a time, with sections 
growing to almost 150 students.<br><br>
The future may offer the ability to acquire additional 
faculty, however, the Universityâ€™s leaders have indicated 
their preference to continue the current approach, with large 
online sections, and have encouraged all faculty involved to 
continue to refine their course approaches and instructional 
delivery to take advantage to the identified best practices and 
continue to alleviate the strain on the institution's pool of 
available graduate-qualified faculty members. It is also the 
reality in higher education that there are never enough 
qualified faculty to accommodate the needs of growing 
programs. The shortage of qualified graduate Cybersecurity 
faculty and the premium salaries of those available make 
hiring on limited budgets even more difficult.
